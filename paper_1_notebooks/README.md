# A pipeline for applying state of the art machine learning to artefact sourcing


The pipeline applies state of the art machine learning to mass-spectrometry data for flint artefacts. The pipeline classifies which bedrock site the artefacts were originally sourced from. 

The pipeline includes data preproccessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, outlier detection, the evaluation of machine learning classifiers and final model building and prediction. 

***
### Notes
* Please set the configuration variables in config.py before running the pipeline, there are descriptions about the paramaters in the config.py file
* the notebooks should be run in the order that they are numbered

This pipeline was originally used for the study referenced below:
