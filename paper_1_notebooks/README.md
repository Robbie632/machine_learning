# A pipeline for applying state of the art machine learning to artefact sourcing


The pipeline applies state of the art machine learning to mass-spectrometry data for flint artefacts. The pipeline classifies which bedrock site the artefacts were originally sourced from. The pipeline includes data preproccessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, machine learning classifiers evaluation and final model building and prediction. 

***

* Please set the configuration variables in config.py before running the pipeline


This pipeline was originally used for the study referenced below:
